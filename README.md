sshportal is a great SSH *Bastion*.

Your can find sourcecode and explaination here: https://github.com/moul/sshportal

But it lakes some features and simplicity some times.
For that I tried to build an UI over this bastion, using the sshportal-api (see: https://github.com/Whyrl35/sshportal-api)
Once the API is set, Install and configure the UI and enjoy sshportal.

To see how to install the API see: [installation](INSTALL.md)

:construction: FOR NOW THIS PROJECT IS IN HEAVY DEVELOPMENT AND NOT READY TO BE USED.
